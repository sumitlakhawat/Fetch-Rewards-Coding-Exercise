# Fetch-Rewards-Coding-Exercise

This project focuses on analyzing the data contained in the receipts.json, brands.json, and users.json files to create a relational ER Diagram. The ER Diagram, in PDF format, provides a visual representation of the relationships among the different entities.

## Files Included

- ERD_FetchRewards.png: This file contains the visual representation of the relational ER Diagram.
- FetchRewardsSQL.sql: This file has SQL queries that answers predetermined questions from a business stakeholder.
- Fetch_Rewards.ipynb: This notebook contains python code that analyses the unstructured data.

## Notebook

The notebook titled "Fetch_Rewards.ipynb" provides a step-by-step analysis of the data. The following tasks were performed:

1. Data Loading: The receipts.json, brands.json, and users.json files were loaded into the notebook.
2. Data Transformation: The data in JSON format was transformed into dataframes for further analysis.
3. Data Issues: Various data quality issues were identified, including missing values and potential outliers.
4. Business Question: A business stakeholder's query was addressed in the notebook to provide insights and analysis.
5. Communication Email: An email was crafted to update the stakeholders on the progress made and highlight the identified issues.

Please refer to the notebook for a detailed analysis and code implementation.

## Next Steps

Moving forward, the following actions are recommended:

1. Data Quality Resolution: The missing values and potential outliers identified in the analysis should be addressed to ensure data accuracy.
2. Stakeholder Collaboration: Further collaboration with business stakeholders is essential to gain a better understanding of their requirements and refine the analysis accordingly.
3. Optimization Opportunities: Additional information about the desired outcomes and objectives of the relational model will help optimize the data assets and query performance.

Please feel free to explore the notebook for a comprehensive understanding of the analysis performed.
